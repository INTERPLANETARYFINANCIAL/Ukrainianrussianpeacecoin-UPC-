Hopefully, we can help heal the world a bit together. We want to teach people How to address issues by talking and I want to get involved with conflict resolution and show the world that you can go through hell and still be kind 
The Token is on TRON Blockchain  
(UPC) is for a very good cause, people are people and Russian lives are just as valuable as anyone’s, they do not deserve to starve, because of their government and in my opinion cruel sanctions put on them by the west, people are suffering people just like you, not the military or Putin, the people who are brainwashed by their government like all people in every country. 
The Ukrainians are suffering a brutal and unprovoked attack on a scale of which hasn’t been seen since world war 2, the fear they would feel trying to get to sleep thinking they could die at any time or lose their children, this is not only military forces fighting each other it’s military killing children and innocents, that fear would be beyond anything, I will #helpbothsides as much as I can, by providing anything they ask me for within the budget.  
I  want the rest of the world to adopt this coin as it will go to great public services and make you a lot of money too :)  
I want to be completely transparent so much so that I have supplied all my personal details that can be verified but please respect my privacy and honesty. 
We look forward to working with Our Community and supporting as many people as we can. We are confident that we can meet the challenges ahead and stand ready to partner with you in delivering an effective Currency and Charity.  
So to The MOON…
